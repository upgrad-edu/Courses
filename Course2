Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Poojitha Anthati
Divide & Conquer Algorithms
Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. If they are small enough, solve the subproblems as base cases.
Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.
