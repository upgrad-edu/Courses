Greedy Algorithm
In the "Greedy Algorithm" module, I gained a deep understanding of a fundamental algorithmic 
strategy used in problem-solving. Greedy algorithms aim to make locally optimal choices at each step in the
hope of finding a globally optimal solution. I learned how to identify problems that are suitable for greedy algorithms, 
such as scheduling and minimum spanning trees. The key insight is to select the best possible choice at each 
stage without worrying about the global picture, which can lead to efficient solutions for a wide range of problems. 
This module helped me appreciate the elegance and efficiency of greedy algorithms in algorithm design and problem-solving.
