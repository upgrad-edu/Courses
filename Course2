greedy Algorithm
A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. ... However, in many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution.




Pawan Dubey
