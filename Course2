Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Parakh Milind Raje
Divide & Conquer Algorithms
This algorithm repeatedly divide problem into two or more sub problem until the sub-problem will solve directly.And then merge solution of these sub-problems repeatedly to get solution of original problem.
