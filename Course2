Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Puneet Pandey
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Learnt the basics of divide and conquer approach
The approch of problem solving prescribes following three steps: 
1. Dividing the problem into sub parts
2. Solving the sub parts
3. Combining the solved sub parts in the whole. 
Some of the divide and conqeur algorithms are:
1. Binary Search
2. Quick Sort
3. Merge Sort
