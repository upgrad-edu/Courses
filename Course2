Divide and Conquer Algorithm
In this module we have learned an algorithm named divide and conquer which is used. This algorithm divides problem into sub divisions and merge them again to solve.

Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.
