Jatin Sharma , Greedy approach  Checkout my work
A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. This means that it makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally-optimal solution. However, generally greedy algorithms do not provide globally optimized solutions.
