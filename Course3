Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks & Queues

1.Stacks and Queues are linear data structures.
2.Stacks follow the LIFO principle, while Queues follow the FIFO principle.
3.Stacks and Queues are used in many programming applications, including implementing function calls and handling undo/redo functionality.
