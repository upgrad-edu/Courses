Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks & Queues
Stacks are similar to putting items on top of the other. Stacks follow last in first out principle.
Queue is similar to an actual queue of people standing in front of billing counter. Queues follow first in first out principle.
