Saubhik Mukherjee
Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graphs

Rohit Janaswamy
Binary Trees & BSTs
I learnt about the different types of Binary Search Trees
I learnt tree traversal. Its of two types BFS and DFS
I have not reached this module yet. So this is something I learnt in university.
