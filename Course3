Saubhik Mukherjee
Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Satya Boni
Stacks & Queues
I understood how the Stacks & Queues manage their lists of elements
I learnt that stacks use operation called push to insert an element into the stack
I learnt that queue use similar operations like rear & front to insert & delete from the data sets
I understood that both the data structures use LIFO & FIFO principles respectively
