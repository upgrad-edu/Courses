Saubhik Mukherjee
Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Sivabalan Shanmugasiva
Binary Trees & BSTs
Learnt about non-linear data structure Trees
Learnt about special type of Trees; Binary & Binary Search Trees
Topic was bit confusing at first but after going through the vidoes, it was interesting and not that tough to understand
Learn about various traversal techniques used to traverse through the nodes of the tree
