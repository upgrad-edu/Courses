1) Version Control System
There are two types of System 1. centralized Version Control & 2. Distributed Version Control.
Centralized version control systems contain just one repository globally and every user need to commit for reflecting oneâ€™s changes in the repository. It is possible for others to see your changes by updating.

Distributed version control systems contain multiple repositories. Each user has their own repository and working copy. Just committing your changes will not give others access to your changes.

In version control system we can Manage & track the changes in program & we can revert the changes in git.
