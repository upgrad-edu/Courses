Saubhik Mukherjee
Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Yash Berry
Hashtables
I haven't learnt any of the modules mentioned here yet since all these topics will be covered in Course 3 and this exercise is from Course 2.
However, this is my first time learning how to code and I am learning new things everyday. The thrill of approaching deadlines every Wednesday is very, for lack of a better word, refreshing.
