Saubhik Mukherjee
Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Sindhuja Sabbani
Searching and Sorting Algorithms
I learnt how to search elements using linear search in O(N) time complexity.
I learnt how to search elements using binary search in O(log N) time complexity.
I learnt how to sort elements using selection,bubble and insertion sort algorithms in O(N^2) time complexity.
