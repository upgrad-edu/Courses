Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks & Queues
They are most basic data structure, but helps to solve a lot of complex problems efficiently.
Programing languages also use stack to keep the flow of function calls. Basic understanding of stack really helps to understand and evaluate the flows.
