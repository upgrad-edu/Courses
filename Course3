Conditionals, Loops & Functions
Under conditionals, I've learned control flow statements like if, else, if-else, nested if, and switch.
Under loops, I've learned how to use a while loop, for loop, and a do-while loop.
Under functions, I've learned how to create a method, and pass and return values from it.
