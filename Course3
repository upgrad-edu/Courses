Stacks & Queues
Major takeaways for me is that a Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
While a Queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.
Both are used for manipulating data using algorithms.
