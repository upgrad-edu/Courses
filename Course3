Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Simran Farheen
Hashtables
I learned what a good hashing algorithm looks like
I learned how hashtables are great datastructures for faster retrievals
I learned how to use hashtables to implement solutions to various real world problems
