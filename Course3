Collaboration 
1). It helps us work with the people around us / world to produce something better than before. 
2). We can copy someone else's repository in GitHub using "Fork" option which allows us to copy the original project into our own account. 
3). Then we can clone the repository / project into our local system to make changes into the project. after making the changes we can   
notify the owners of the repostiory of our changes by making a pull request and then they can decide whether to accept it or to reject it.
