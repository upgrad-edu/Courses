Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks & Queues
It is one of the first and basic module and vastly used in computer science. Stack is like array but having restriction of access. 
You can add and remove the elements from one end only. In case of Array you can do random things but stack do not allow it. 
Queue on other hand also restricted access but allow to add element from one end and remove from another end. 

These two basic data structures are used in almost everything in CS from program control management to priority queue etc.
