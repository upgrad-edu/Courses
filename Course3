Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks & Queues
We use stack or queue instead of arrays/lists when we want the elements in a specific orde.
i.e. in the order we put them (queue) or in the reverse order (stack).
Queues and stacks are dynamic while arrays are static,so when we require dynamic memory we use queue or stack over arrays.
