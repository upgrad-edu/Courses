Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Testing and Version Control
I have learnt on how unit test cases are written with names, indicating their business usage.
If there are multiple scenarios in a method, all of those scenarios must be tested.
There are multiple assertion statements that are appropriate for the different outcomes expected.
Mocking is a great way to induce independence in cases where methods are heavily reliant on one another.
