Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Design and Prototyping
Prototyping:
An incomplete version of the software product that demonstrates the functions of the product once it is implemented and the way in which the product would function in the real world.
Used for fetching customer feedback without developing the complete software.
Further refinements are made as more feedback is collected.
Saves a lot of time without actually building the final software.
