Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks & Queue
Stacks and Queue are the linear data structures.
Stacks follow first in last out principle.
Queues follow first in first out principle.
The elements in Stacks and Queues are traversed using pointers.
