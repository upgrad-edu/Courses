Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks and queues
I learnt about stacks and its various applications such as in parsing mechanism of compilers,undo of browsers etc.And the elements in stack follow Last In First Out order.
Next about queue and its application in various sheduling algorithms,various operations in queues and stacks.
