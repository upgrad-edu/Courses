Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks & Queues
Stacks are based on the LIFO principle i.e. the element inserted at the last, is the first element to come out of the list.
Queues are based on the FIFO principle i.e. the element inserted at the first, is the first element to come out of the list.
For implementation of a queue, a minimum of 2 stacks are required.
