Stacks & Queues
Stacks are based on the LIFO principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last, is the first element to come out of the list.
Queues are data structure that stores a collection of elements, with operations to enqueue (add) elements at the back of the queue, and dequeue (remove) elements from the front of the queue.
Difference between stack & queue implementation.
