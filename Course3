Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stcaks & Queues
Stacks are data structures that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.
Queues, on the other hand, adhere to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.
Both stacks and queues are commonly used in computer science for managing data and implementing various algorithms.
