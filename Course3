Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Stacks & Queues

I have learned the Stacks 


Stack A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top 
The queue data structure follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle
 i.e. the elementpush() − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.

pop() − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.
inserted at first in the list, is the first element to be removed from the list.


Still I am learning....
