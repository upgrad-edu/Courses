Saubhik Mukherjee
Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Sujata Ganguly
Stacks and queues
Although we are yet to cover data structures so I am taking overview of all the topics mentioned here.
I have some knowledge on Stacks so I chose it as part of current exercise.
