The module name of your choice from Course 3 - git commands
I have been using github and gitlab for a while, but has been always using the GitHub desktop GUI to work locally and commit to the repository. This 
module helped understand the basics of how git works, the states of commit (modified, staged, commited) and all the commands. I got much better with the 
commands now including branching, merging, deleting, reverting etc., It was fun learning this module.
