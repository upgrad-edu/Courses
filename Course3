5)Graphs & Graph Algorithms


Rohit Kundliwal
Binary Trees & BSTs
I learned that if the data structure is not well planned, the time taken for the algorithm can be very high. Choosing the right data structure is very important.
I also learned that Binary Trees are T(o) of logN
I learned different types of transversals (DFS and BFS) 
I learned difference between Binary tree and Binary Search Tree - and how BST are better in many ways.
P.s. I did not like the way this session was carried, the professor did not
explain things well. Specially for me, since I dont have coding background! :)


Saubhik Mukherjee
Graphs & Graph Algorithms
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed grap
