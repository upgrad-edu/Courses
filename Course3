Saubhik Mukherjee
I learnt how to implement a graph using edge list, adjacency lists and adjacency matrix.
I learnt how to do BFS and DFS traversals on a graph.
I learnt how to use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a vertex in a directed graph.

Name: Subhankar Pradhan
Module: Graphs & Graph Algorithms
Learnings:
1. How the data structure works and how it differs in what aspects from Binary trees
2. Different traversal techniques
3. Algorithms related to graphs, usage of graph, it's representation etc.
