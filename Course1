My favourite module is Course 1 - "Additional References - Pre-Requisite"
Being a fresher, this was slightly challenging in the beginning but as I worked through this one, I enjoyed applying what I learnt so far (basics of programming) at that time to solve a real problem. It gave me confidence and motivation to learn more and test my knowledge and solve problems. This was a really fun exercise.
