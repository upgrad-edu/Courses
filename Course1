Hello My name is Aniruddha Acharya
My Favorite module is "Abstraction & Polymorphism".
I liked this module as it enhancing the code being less repetitive.
Delivering with more secure way with access modifier.
And allowing rewriting the java methods such a way with polymorphism.
After Learning basics of OOPS and Java Programming, this has been quite industry relevant.
