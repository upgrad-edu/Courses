Hello My name is Ankit Gajera

My Favorite module would be Inheritance and Polymorphism.

In this module, I learnt about how we can reuse the code and make our code compact and easily readable with less lines of code.
Using Polymorphism, we can create more than one function with same name which is very useful sometimes as we don't need to think about the different function having kind of functionalities.
