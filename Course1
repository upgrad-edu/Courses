Hello My name is Ayan Chakravorty
My Favorite module would be Arrays, ArrayList and Linked Lists.
This module helped me understand the various ways of managing collection of data using arrays, ArrayList and LinkedList. Also I liked the concepts of Inheritance and Polymorphism, how they help us achieve real-life functionalities through programming.
