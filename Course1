COURSE : Course 1 Module 1
REMARK : Tricha madam laid out the foundations of computational thinking brilliantly. Programming languages, IDE features and other such skills can be picked up easily, but the approach of tackling a problem is crux of computer science. I believe this should either be looked further into right at the beginning or in the middle of course again.

COURSE : Course 2 Module 1
REMARK : Design and analysis of algorithms is "computational thinking put down on paper". Examples of different types of algorithms merely serve as insight into the clockwork, although it is important but a good eagle's eye view is crucial.

COURSE : Course 3 xxxxxxxx
REMARK : I didn't found anything of interest in here. Data structure is the clay you make your item out of. This course just described a few popular data structures. There are online lectures by Donald Knuth himself which are far more insightful, instructive and thought provoking than the ones presented in this course. I think there should be an introductory module illustrating reasons for existance of multiple datastructures and their uses.

*NOTE : Any constructive criticism is most welcomed and encouraged. Please do point out if there is any fault in my thought process.
