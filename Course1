Hello My name is Geetika Agarwal.

My Favorite module would be Merging two branches.

This module helped me do the merging of two branches from command line instead of doing it by uploading all the files in the github. 
It was a really easy take to do from the pc than uploading it as we have to always upload all the files in the directory to merge the 
changes rather than just that file.
