Hello World! My name is Harshada Samant
I enjoyed learning and working with Conditionals, Loops and Functions. 
Handling Conditional statements, looping through the code made my logical thinking more strong. Working with functions was fun as I could see my code was doing something and showing some outputs on the screen. I loved it!!!
