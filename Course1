Hello, my name is Ashutosh Pathak.

My favourite module from course 2 is Abstraction & Encapsulation.

Abstraction and encapsulation are the most used features of OOP.
One of the biggest paradigm shift when moving from procedural to OOP is that you need a class for any 
behaviour. You can't have method outside of class itself!
