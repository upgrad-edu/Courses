Hello My name is Anup Mishra
My Favorite module would be Arrays and Linked Lists.

My favourite module from course1 is Functions.
Functions are used to have reusability implemented in the program.
Functions can take arguments as per requirement.
The important feature about functions is overriding and overloading which is implemented using the Polymorphysm feature of OOP.
Hope this learning experience will land me to my suitable place :')
