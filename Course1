SDLC and Agile Methodology
In this module we learned about the different Software Development Process, such as Waterfall, Spiral and Agile (XP).  
We saw the differences, advantages and disadvantages about each one, and in which scenarios we should adopt one or other.
At the end, we could go deeper into Agile philosofy and how to use it effectivelly in our work.
