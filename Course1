Hello My name is Anup Mishra
My Favorite module would be Arrays and Linked Lists.
This module helped me land a job at my current employer. Also this module helped me understand to use the large arrays efficiently.This module also helped me to think logically for ADT's.

Arrays and LinkedList
I learnt two different school of storing data in memory - Arrays and LinkedList. 
Arrays store any data in contagious manner that offers highly efficient access rates whilst lacking in deletion 
and addition.
LinkedList, however, stores data in non-contagious manner that uses a connected list of nodes.
These nodes may be one-way connected giving rise to a singly-LinkedList 
or two-way which is called a doubly-LinkedList.
Lists can be traversed using its head or tail, offers easy implementation of any node/data point 
at any point but does not offer direct accesses like Arrays.
