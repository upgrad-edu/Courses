Hello My name is Anup Mishra
My Favorite module would be Arrays and Linked Lists.
This module helped me land a job at my current employer. Also this module helped me understand to use the large arrays efficiently.This module also helped me to think logically for ADT's.

module name - version control
I liked branching and cloneing from this module as it makes development easier and also we can track easily the history of the project using virson control.
Distributd version control is more reliable because it doesn't rely on single repository so errors would be less amd managing history becomes easy.
